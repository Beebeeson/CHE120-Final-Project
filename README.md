RUN THE .PY FILE NAMED "1.3", THAT IS THE FINAL VERSION OF OUR GAME
all of the pciture files are integral to the project as they are used to create the animated bavkgrounds and character, 
  MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD THEM WITH MAIN FILE "1.3" TO MAKE SURE THAT THE GAME CAN RUN!!!
two .py files containing the word "test" were testing files created to experient on the functionality of animations, they are not part of the main game! 
  (they also serve as evidence to inform that we actually typed down the codes outselves and ran it through some tests to make sure they work.)
thank you for reading this file!
